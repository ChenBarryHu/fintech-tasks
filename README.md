## 1. Candle chart with 1 minute period (open, high, low, close, volume_base, volume_quote)
**how can the indicator generally be used to assess the market?**
The Open-High-Low-Close(OHLC)/Candle chart shows increasing or decreasing momentum:
When the open and close are far apart it shows strong momentum, and when the open and close are close together it shows indecision or weak momentum. The high and low are useful in assessing volatility.

## 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) on a period of 20 minutes
**how can the indicator generally be used to assess the market?**
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) describes the current price relative to average high and low prices over a previous trading period. This indicator estimates overbought or oversold status.      

WHen the RSI values are above a given threshold (commonly 70), this indicate an overbought market (time to sell!); and when the values are below a given threshold (commonly 30), this indicates an oversold market (time to buy!).

## 3. Moving Average Convergence Divergence(MACD)
**how can the indicator generally be used to assess the market?**
MACD shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.      

A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line.

## 4. Bollinger Band
**how can the indicator generally be used to assess the market?**
A common conprehension is that: For a Bollinger Band, the closer the prices move to the upper band, the more overbought the market (time to sell), and the closer the prices move to the lower band, the more oversold the market(time to buy).
